This project is a Survey Management API built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to create and manage surveys, questions, and responses. The API provides endpoints for user authentication, survey creation, question management, and response collection.
### Note checkout the comments in the project, for the developers who want to further develop it
### `npm install` or else use `nmp install --force` command
1. So if you delete the node_modules folder by mistake or by purpose, then this will help us to install all the dependencies/packages mentioned in the package.json file

### In public folder 
1. There is a set of files, along with index.html. HTML files is useful to add the script tags, link tags related to your packages like bootstrap and so on.

### In api folder
1. This is the backend framework called ExpressJS that help us to perform CRUD operations on database.
2. In this index.js file is the main file where we refer all the working of the backend operations of this project.
## 3. Process of installation
3. 1. Created a folder named api. 
3. 2. Open the terminal and run the command `npm init --y` 
3. 3. Install the dependencies using command `npm install`. So So if you delete the node_modules folder by mistake or by purpose, then this will help us to install all the dependencies/packages mentioned in the package.json file.
3. 4. Now start working on the project. For more documentation of ExpressJS visit `https://expressjs.com/` or for installing packages visit `https://www.npmjs.com/`
