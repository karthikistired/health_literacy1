                Instructions:
                The following words are common dental terms. Please read each word aloud as clearly as you can.
                If you do not know how to pronounce a word, please guess.
                You will receive one point for each word that you read correctly

                Scoring:
                One point is awarded for each word that is read correctly.
                The total score can range from 0 to 99, with higher scores indicating higher levels of health literacy


                Interpretation:
                The REALD-99 is interpreted by comparing the individual's score to the norms for the test. The norms are based on the performance of a large sample of adults in the United States. The norms are divided into five levels of health literacy:
                Level 1: Very low literacy
                Level 2: Low literacy
                Level 3: Marginal literacy
                Level 4: Adequate literacy
                Level 5: High literacy
                An individual's score on the REALD-99 can be used to identify their level of health literacy and to target educational interventions. For example, an individual who scores at Level 1 on the REALD-99 may need more support in understanding dental terminology and instructions.
