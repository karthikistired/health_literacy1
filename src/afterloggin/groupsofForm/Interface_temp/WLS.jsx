                Interpretation: The scoring of the Weight Literacy Scale is as follows:
                0-5: Very low weight literacy
                6-11: Low weight literacy
                12-17: Moderate weight literacy
                18-23: High weight literacy
            </p>

            <p>
                The average score on the Weight Literacy Scale is 20.6 out of 31 items, which means that participants answered two thirds of the items correctly. This indicates that there is substantial room for improvement in weight literacy
            </p>

            <p>
                A score of 18 or higher indicates that a person has a good understanding of weight control and the factors that influence weight. A score of 17 or lower indicates that a person may benefit from additional information and resources about weight management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Weight Literacy Scale is a valuable tool for assessing and improving weight literacy. It can be used to identify individuals who may benefit from weight literacy interventions. The Weight Literacy Scale can also be used to track changes in weight literacy over time
