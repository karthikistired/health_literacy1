                The SILS is a single-item tool that is used to screen for inadequate health literacy. The question asks how often a person needs help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. The answer options range from "never" to "always."
                <b>Interpretation</b>
                The critical nutrition literacy instrument is a 17-item scale that is scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The scale has been shown to be reliable and valid in measuring critical nutrition literacy among adolescents and adults.
            </p>
            <p>
                Score:
                The SILS is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "never" and 5 being "always." A score of 2 or higher is considered to be a positive screen for inadequate health literacy.
                Interpretation of scores:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Score of 1: This indicates that the person does not need help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. </li>
                <li> Score of 2: This indicates that the person sometimes needs help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. </li>
                <li> Score of 3: This indicates that the person often needs help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. </li>
                <li> Score of 4: This indicates that the person frequently needs help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. </li>
                <li> Score of 5: This indicates that the person always needs help when reading written material from their doctor or pharmacy. </li>
            </ul>
